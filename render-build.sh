# #!/usr/bin/env bash: This is called a "shebang" line and indicates which interpreter should be used to execute the script. In this case, it specifies that the Bash shell should be used.

# set -o errexit: This sets an option in the shell to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status, indicating an error.

# bundle install: This command installs the dependencies specified in the project's Gemfile using the Bundler tool.

# bundle exec rake assets:precompile: This command compiles and generates any static assets needed for the project, such as CSS and JavaScript files.

# bundle exec rake assets:clean: This command removes any previously compiled assets that are no longer needed.

# bundle exec rake db:migrate: This command runs any database migrations needed for the project, updating the database schema to match the current version of the code.

# Overall, this script is likely used to prepare the project for deployment by ensuring all dependencies are installed, static assets are generated, and the database is updated to the current schema.
